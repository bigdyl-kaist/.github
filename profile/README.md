The Laboratory of Big Data Analytics and Learning (BigDyL pronounced as Big Deal) in Web, Industrial, and Scientific Environments (WISE), was established in March 2020 at Yonsei University and moved to KAIST in February 2024. We are now studying the following problems:

- Time Series/Spatiotemporal Synthesis, Forecasting, and Anomaly Detection,
- Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering and Sequential Recommendation),
- Tabular Data Synthesis and Representation Learning,
- Differential Equation-based Deep Learning and Physics-informed Neural Networks,
- Graph Convolutional Networks,
- Deep Generative Models.
